# Welcome to Water Angular Jumps Codes

These tools computes the angular jump statistics of water molecules in
liquid water and aqueous solutions from an molecular-dynamics trajectory.

# Installation

**Requirements:** Fortran compiler (*e.g.* gfortran).
Run complile.sh script
```
./compile.sh
```

After compilations two executables: (1) swap.x & (2) avg.x 
would be created within executable directory.
